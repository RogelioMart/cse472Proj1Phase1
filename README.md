## Style Guide

### Branch Name Guidelines

#### Naming Conventions

- One feature or bug per branch.
- Names should be all lowercase.
- Separate words with a hyphen.
- Make names short and descriptive.
- Prepend a branch tag that describes your branch.
- If working on a branch alone, append your first name.

#### Tags

- `feat` ---- Feature I'm adding or expanding
- `bug` ---- Bug fix
- `wip` ---- Work in progress, experiments; won't be finished soon

### Commit Message Guidelines

#### Template

> The `type` and `subject` go on the `summary` line.

```
[type]: [subject]

[body]

[footer]
```

##### Type

> The `type` must be **one** of the following:

- **feat**: Add new **feature** or 3D asset
- **fix**: Fix a **bug** or remove useless assets
- **docs**: **Documentation** changes (changing XML comments, updating README, etc)
- **refactor**: Any change that *neither* fixes a bug nor adds a feature, but **does** change the meaning of the code (changing a script to improve performance)
- **style**: Code change that is **not** documentation and does **not** affect the meaning of code (white-space, formatting, etc)
- **test**: Adding or correcting unit tests
- **build**: Change that affects external dependencies

##### Subject

- The subject contains a succinct description of the change.
- Use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes".
- Don't capitalize the first letter.
- No period at the end.

##### Body

- The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.
- Use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes".

##### Footer

- **Optional**. If the commit closes an issue that's been opened on GitHub, then link that issue here.
