How to use

Don't delete any of the files.

If you just want to run the naive bayes simply run 

<python NBC_Project.py>

That is all you will need.

That will run the naive bayes and display metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, & more.

If you want to change the data that is used to train and/or test the naive bayes 
implementation. To change the training data you will need to change the file names in lines 
18 & 19 with in the Bot_Test.py file with file names. The files must have the same format
as the original ones too.
If you want to change the testing data you will need to change the file names in lines 760 &
761. Again the files that you replace them with will need to have the same format.
We do not recomend you do this at all. But if you do and you're succesful. If the new
files are big enough to be measured in megabytes running 

<Python Bot_Test.py>

Is likely to take 10 to 15 minutes and the program will warn you of it when you run it.
